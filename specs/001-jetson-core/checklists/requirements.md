# Specification Quality Checklist: Sentry Jetson Core

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

- 5 user stories covering all system responsibilities (P1→P5).
- 28 functional requirements with no ambiguities remaining.
- 8 measurable success criteria including latency, tracking fidelity, GPS accuracy,
  and 72-hour stability.
- Assumptions section documents sentry GPS source, Arduino firmware boundary,
  and pre-converted TensorRT model.
